# Skyway Documentation

Skyway is a software package developed at [the University of Chicago, Research Computing Center](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/) that allows users to burst computing workloads from the on-premise clusters to run on remote commercial cloud platforms such as Amazon AWS, Google GCP and Microsoft Azure. Skyway enables users to run computing tasks in the cloud from Midway in a seamless manner.

The official [Skyway](https://cloud-skyway.rcc.uchicago.edu/) homepage gives useful information for getting started.

## Overview

From the user persepectives, Skyway functions in a similar way to a HPC cluster where they can transfer data in and out, compile software or load existing modules, submit jobs either to on-premises compute nodes, or to virtual machines (aka instances) from a cloud service provider. The [User Guide](user_overview.md) provides more information.

The [Developer Guide](developer_overview.md) describes ways to add more functionalities to Skyway.
