# Skyway

Skyway is an integrated platform developed at the U Chicago Research Computing
Center to allow users to burst computing workloads from the on-premise HPC cluster,
to run on remote commercial cloud platforms such as Amazon AWS,
Google GCP, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Skyway enables users
to access cloud resources in a seamless manner with both command line and graphical
user interfaces.
