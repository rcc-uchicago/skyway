# Skyway

Skyway is an integrated platform developed at the RCC 
to allow users to burst computing workloads from the on-premise RCC cluster,
Midway, to run on remote commercial cloud platforms such as Amazon AWS,
Google GCP and Microsoft Azure. Skyway enables users to run computing tasks
in the cloud from Midway in a seamless manner without needing
to learn how to provision cloud resources. Since the user does not need to
setup or manage cloud resources themselves, the result is improved productivity
with a minimum learning curve.

available through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Skyway-cloud/).
